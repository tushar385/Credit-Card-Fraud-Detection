# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Description-  
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Steps Performed-  
1-Exploratory Data Analysis.  
2-Createing Dependent and Independent Features.  
4-We define Outlier Detection Parameter for Isolation Forest Algorithm and Local Outlier Factor Algorithm.    
3-We Fit and Predict the Data.   

Result-  
After Comparing the Accuracy Score and Classification Report we can say Isolation Forest Algorithm outperformed Local Outlier Factor Algorithm.
